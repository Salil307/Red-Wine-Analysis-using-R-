Overview
This project focuses on the comprehensive analysis of red wine characteristics using the R programming language. Leveraging R's powerful data analysis and visualization capabilities, we aim to gain insights into various attributes of red wines.
This project is all about performing data analysis on Red wine to check its quality by analyzing its properties like alcohol content, acidity,etc.
Tools and Libraries Used
R: The primary programming language for data analysis and visualization.
RStudio: An integrated development environment (IDE) for R.
Tidyverse: A collection of R packages for data manipulation and visualization.
ggplot2: A versatile package for creating static and interactive visualizations.
dplyr: For data manipulation and summarization.
caret: Used for building and evaluating predictive models.
Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning and Exploration: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring data integrity.
Descriptive Statistics: Calculating summary statistics to understand the central tendency and variability of the wine attributes.
Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using ggplot2 to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
Correlation Analysis: Examining the relationships between different features and identifying potential predictors of wine quality.
Predictive Modeling: Building a predictive model to estimate wine quality based on selected features.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the predictive model using relevant metrics.
Insights and Conclusions: Summarizing findings and providing actionable insights for wine enthusiasts and industry professionals.
